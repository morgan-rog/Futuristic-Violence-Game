## Project Description

This is a game I create in Unity called Futuristic Violence!
It is a boss battle type game where the player on the left is trying to defeat the enemy on the
right by taking shots at it. The player can refill their health by collecting a powerup that will
spawn at a random place on the ground. The enemy is randomly shooting at the player and the player
needs to avoid the enemy shots by jumping.
